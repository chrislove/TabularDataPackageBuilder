# TabularDataPackage

[Tabular Data Package](http://dataprotocols.org/tabular-data-package/) is a technology-agnostic format for publishing/transporting data. It uses text files (in the form of CSV files and a JSON file) to house data and define the nature (i.e. data-types) of that data.
The aim here is to create a data publishing format that can be used to move data between different systems via text files.
