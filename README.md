# Tabular Data Package Builder

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/hqkyu432hlh7xhic/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/matt40k/tabulardatapackagebuilder/branch/master)

[Tabular Data Package](http://dataprotocols.org/tabular-data-package/) is a technology-agnostic format for publishing/transporting data. It uses text files (in the form of CSV files and a JSON file) to house data and define the nature (i.e. data-types) of that data.
The aim is to create a data publishing format that can be used to move data between different systems via text files.

The [Tabular Data Package Builder](https://github.com/matt40k/TabularDataPackageBuilder/) is a simple Windows application designed to produce or update DataPackage.json for a group of CSV files.
